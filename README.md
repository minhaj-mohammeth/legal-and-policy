# 🏛️ legal-and-policy

**A transparent commitment to legal rigor, ethical standards, and data integrity for civil rights claims.**

This public repository documents the **legal and technical requirements** that govern the evidence collection and analytical models within the private **Rules of Conduct Civil Rights App**. It serves as a commitment to ensuring that data collected is **court-submissible** in litigation.

***

## I. 🛡️ Data Standards & Federal Claims

This section details the protocols for evidence generation, ensuring the data is structured to meet the strict legal thresholds of federal civil rights statutes, specifically **42 U.S.C. § 1983** (conspiracy under color of law), **§ 1985**, and **§ 1986**.

| Legal Doctrine | Documentation Focus | Purpose in the App |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Evidence Admissibility** | **Chain of Custody Protocol (FRE 901):** Standards for secure, timestamped, and cryptographically verified logging of digital evidence from capture to export. | Establishes the necessary foundation for introducing digital evidence in a court of law. |
| **Proving Agreement** | **Circumstantial Evidence Protocol:** Criteria for aggregating disparate data points across cases to demonstrate a **"meeting of the minds"** or patterns of **willful blindness** consistent with conspiracy. | Translates individual misconduct reports into evidence of **systemic failure and collusion**. |
| **Color of Law Mapping** | **Official Role §1983 Mapping:** Structured data models linking specific official roles (e.g., judicial, law enforcement) to the legal requirement of acting **"under color of state law."** | Ensures the App focuses on misconduct that meets the threshold for federal jurisdiction. |

## II. ⚖️ Compliance & Governance

This addresses the ethical, compliance, and legal standards required for handling sensitive case data.

* **Data Security Modeling:** Adopting security and privacy principles modeled after **HIPAA security rules** to protect highly sensitive civil rights case data. This includes standards for **Access Controls** and **End-to-End Encryption**.
* **Deprivation Event Logging:** Defines precise logging requirements for events that constitute a clear **constitutional injury** (e.g., denial of due process, illegal seizure, etc.) to satisfy the claim's elements.
* **Overt Act Documentation:** Provides templates or checklists for documenting the specific, observable actions taken by an individual professional in furtherance of a conspiracy ($\text{§} 1985$).
* **Neglect to Prevent Criteria:** Analytical definitions to distinguish simple professional **negligence** from actionable **willful failure to act** or **neglect to prevent** a known conspiracy ($\text{§} 1986$).

***

## III. 🤖 Ethical AI & Transparency

* **Ethical Data and Bias Auditing:** Public methodology for testing and documenting the analytical models to prevent **algorithmic bias** when identifying patterns of negligence or conspiracy.
* **Professional Misconduct Mapping:** Structured data (e.g., JSON/YAML) mapping specific acts of misconduct to relevant **Rules of Professional Conduct** (for attorneys) and $\text{§} 1983$ claims, aiding in automated complaint generation.
* **Terms of Service Principles:** Public outline of user rights, data ownership clauses, and clear disclaimers regarding the app's provision of legal information versus legal advice.
